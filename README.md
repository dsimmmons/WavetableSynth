# WavetableSynth
This is a JUCE project for a morphable wavetable oscilator. It can turn any .wav file into wavetables to use in its oscilator. The oscilator is built to be anti aliasing. In the future this will be a fully functional synthesizer with filters, an FM matrix, LFO's and a suite of built in audio effects.
